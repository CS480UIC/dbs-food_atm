# Database description
We are interested in designing a database system for nonprofit hunger organizations like Feed My Starving Children that would connect to a sort of "food ATM". The database would store customer account information, as well as food information such as the nutrition facts, amount of each item, and "price" (this would depend on the person's need when trying to access the "ATM"). The database would work in conjunction with both software and hardware, as well as a "key" of sorts for each customer. The software would be a database application that would consist of a user interface in order for the user to interact with their account provided by the organization. This software would be attached to a piece of equipment similar to that of an ATM  or vending machine, where food would be stored inside that users could access. They would use a key (some sort of card, similar to a debit card) in order to authenticate and access their "funds". The funds would come from the organization, where they would access the client's food needs, and allot funds that could be spent at the organization's machines only in order to get food. When searching for "homeless vending machine" on Google, it seems as though the organization Action Hunger  has a similar idea, where they have produced vending machines with food for homeless people. However, this idea is different because it would serve as a system not just for homeless people, but also those who do not have enough income to sufficiently feed their families. The system would be transactional, not just free food.
